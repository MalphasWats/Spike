# Spike

Spike is a handheld gaming console based on ATMega Microcontrollers.

I've been playing around with this idea for a long while and the Spike is the current 'state-of-the-art' for me.

The main spike board has:

* 128x64px monochrome OLED display
* Piezo speaker
* 7 buttons (plus reset)
* 3.7v Lipo battery
* Micro-USB port for charging & data

The *shard* board provides the brains and connects via an edge connector on the back of the main board.

Currently I'm using an ATMega1284p running at 16MHz.

I've written a little [more detail on my blog](http://www.subdimension.co.uk/2019/01/16/spike-next-gen-portable-gaming.html).
